# Development Overview
This document contains the project development outline and assignments as well as associated timeline and project roadmap. This is intended to be used as a tool for organizing our project development and understanding our needs to meet out timeline.

# Project Roadmap
This Gantt chart represents a starting point for understanding the timeline for our development and serves a roadmap for our development stages. This a high-level chart showing the different parts of the project and how development time can ovelap. Currently, this is non-finalized and is intended only as a starting point for discussing the relative timelines of tasks.

# Project Outline
This outline captures the main features shown in the project roadmap above. This outline can be more detailed and contains some project steps that are less useful in the top-level roadmap. We should plan to refine the use of these tools over time to capture the parts of the project that need to be represented at a top-level plan and a more detailed overview that collects all of the parts we are working on.
