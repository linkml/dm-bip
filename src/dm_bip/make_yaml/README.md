# Make YAML

Tools for converting Stata code files (.do files) that auto-generate YAML transformation specifications into Python.

## Status

This module is under development as part of the DMC Integration work. See [GitHub Issue #175](https://github.com/linkml/dm-bip/issues/175) for progress on incorporating the Stata YAML authoring tool.

## Purpose

Some data teams use Stata scripts to generate LinkML-Map transformation specification YAML files. This module will provide Python equivalents or converters for those workflows.
